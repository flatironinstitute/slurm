This profiling plugin simply writes the current profile values to files in the
configured ProfileExporterDir directory.  It does not keep any history.  It is
intended for use with the accompanying export-profile-prometheus.py exporter
script, which exposes these values to prometheus on a separate web server.  It
could also theoretically be used by other exporters.

The plugin has two parameters in acct_gather.conf:
  ProfileExporterDir: directory to export values to.  The recommended values in
    /run/slurm/profile or other ramdisk location.  For each running job step,
    the following directory structure will be created here:
      JOBID.STEP/
        alloc: file with static step allocation info, example:
          time STARTTIME
          node NODENAME
          user USERNAME
          tasks NTASKS
          cpus NCORES
          cpus_per_task NCORES
          mem MEMORY
          GRES [TYPE:]COUNT
          ...
        TASKID: file per taskid with current profiling values
          time SAMPLETIME
        ...: any other profiling datasets that are enabled
  ProfileExporterDefault: default profiling value (e.g., "All")
